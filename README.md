## About:

Encrypto is an upgrade to a previous project found [here](https://github.com/emvouvakis/Encrypto_GUI). It uses the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm, which guarantees that a message cannot be read without the key.

The encrypted passwords can be saved in a local file or in Google Drive.
